### Screen Calibration

#### Retroarch

The Powkiddy X55 screen is miscalibrated from the factory. While there's no universal fix (yet) this issue can greatly be mitigated by using a Retroarch Shader. Instructions for doing so are listed below:

1. Start a game
2. Open the "Quick Menu" in Retroarch by pressing both joysticks
3. Navigate to "Shaders"
4. Turn "Video Shader" to "ON"
5. Navigate to "Load Preset"
6. Select "Misc" -> "Image Adjustment"
7. Go to "Shader Parameters" and change the following parameters:
- Target Gamma -> 2.50 (see [Target Gamma](#target-gamma))
- Monitor Gamma 1.70
- Saturation -> 1.40
- Contrast -> 1.10
- Black Level -> -0.15
8. Optionally you may enable the following tweaks:
- Modify "Red Channel" -> 1.05 and "Blue Channel" -> 0.95 for a warmer screen temperature
- If your screen has a line of "garbage" pixels on the right, modify "X Modifier" -> "-0.00"
9.  Navigate back to the shader menu and pick "Save Preset"
10.  Select Either:
- Recommended: "Save Global Preset" to have this as the default for all Retroarch cores
- "Save Core Preset" to have this as the default for a specific system (e.g all PSX games)
- "Save Content Preset" to have this as the default for a specific directory (e.g all roms in a "RPG" directory)
- "Save Game Preset" to have this as the default for the specific game that you're running

The settings at 7 are just a proposal, you might want to experiment a bit to get something that matches your preferences but they should serve as a great starting point.

As a bonus, adjust the "Horizontal Overscan %" and "Vertical Overscan %" settings to deal with e.g PSX games that have black borders (such as Crash Tag Team Racing and Spyro).

The black bars on the sides when displaying 4:3 content will not be effected by shaders and might thus look lighter than the game image. If you find this distracting a (lighter) overlay will hide this issue.

#### PPSSPP

PPSSPP supports postprocessing shaders and a fix can be applied in a similar way as for Retroarch.

1. Start a game
2. Open the "Quick Menu" in PPSSPP by pressing down on the left joysticks
3. Navigate to "Display layout & effects" and click on the "+" button
4. Navigate to "Postprocessing shaders" and select "Color correction"
5. Enter the following settings:
    - Brightness -> 1.0
    - Saturation -> 1.20
    - Contrast -> 0.85
    - Gamma -> 0.8
6. Depending on the selected game you might want to tweak the settings above but they should serve as a good starting point.

#### Target Gamma
A Target Gamma of 2.5 matches closely with what CRT TVs targeted for. For darker games you might want to try a lower value. For handheld systems a gamma value of 1.8 - 2.2 is usually optimal. Below is a table of common retro handhelds with a suggested Target Gamma value.

| Handheld                 | Target Gamma / Display Characteristics                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Game Boy (Original)       | **No specific gamma** - 4 shades of gray, reflective, not backlit. No "gamma" in the traditional sense. | The original Game Boy's display was very basic. Emulators often try to recreate its unique look, including the green tint, ghosting, and motion blur.                                                                                         |
| Game Boy Color           | **Non-uniform, reflective LCD** (~1.8 at the low end, ~2.2 at the high end)                               | The GBC had a wider color palette and a brighter screen than the original Game Boy but was still reflective and not backlit. It's color reproduction is often described as washed out or muted.                                            |
| Game Boy Advance         | **Non-uniform, reflective LCD** (~1.8 at the low end, ~2.2 at the high end), but often perceived as quite dark. | The original GBA screen was notorious for being dark and difficult to see without direct light. The perceived gamma can appear higher due to the lack of a backlight.                                                                    |
| Game Boy Advance SP (AGS-001) | **Frontlit LCD, closer to ~1.8-2.2**                                                                     | The first GBA model with a built-in light. While a significant improvement, the frontlight could create a washed-out look.                                                                                                                 |
| Game Boy Advance SP (AGS-101) | **Backlit LCD, closer to ~2.2**                                                                      | The most sought-after GBA model due to its brighter, backlit screen. Provides a more vibrant and modern display experience.                                                                                                              |
| Nintendo DS (original & Lite) | **Backlit LCD, ~2.2**                                                                                    | The DS features dual backlit screens and was significantly brighter than previous Nintendo handhelds.                                                                                                                                   |
| Sega Game Gear           | **Backlit LCD, ~1.8-2.2** (Similar to a dim CRT, but with potential for blurriness)                       | The Game Gear had a backlit color screen, which was advanced for its time but still relatively dim compared to modern displays and prone to motion blur. The backlight could also have inconsistencies of its own.                  |
| Sega Nomad               | **Backlit LCD, ~1.8-2.2** (Similar to Game Gear, potentially slightly brighter, with less blur)          | Essentially a portable Genesis, the Nomad also had a backlit screen. It might appear slightly brighter than the Game Gear and was updated during production from a double to single fluorescent bulb, getting slightly dimmer as a result. |

                                                                                       |
