### New displays (R36s of year 2024)

Recent R36s have new displays that need some extra actions to work.

The simplest way so far is:

* Determine which panel do you have (or just try every option until it works)
* Download a `mipi-panel.dtbo.r36s-panel*` [there](https://github.com/stolen/r.nix-distribution/releases/tag/panel_overlays)
* Rename the downloaded file and put it to a boot (`ROCKNIX`) partition as `overlays/mipi-panel.dtbo`

These files mostly have just basic refresh rate (77.378 FPS) (`panel4` has 50, 60, 75 because we tested it)

If you have an original `.dtb` file, you can generate a `mipi-panel.dtbo` from it.  
Assuming you have an [SSH](/faqs/#how-do-i-log-in-over-ssh-or-samba) access and you have `scp`'d the original dtb as `rk3326-r35s-linux.dtb`, the process would be as follows:
```console
RK3326:~ # mount -o remount,rw /flash
RK3326:~ # mkdir -p /flash/overlays/
RK3326:~ # ### Be not afraid! importpanel.py may run for a minute or two for some panels
RK3326:~ # /usr/libexec/generic-dsi/importpanel.py rk3326-r35s-linux.dtb -O dtbo -o /flash/overlays/mipi-panel.dtbo
RK3326:~ # sync; mount -o remount,ro /flash/
```
Here we just make an overlays directory writable, then call a script that does all the importing stuff.  
Feel free to run this script on your PC, modify it and experiment with panel timings.  

This script adds a bunch of potentially useful refresh rates, but we have very few knowledge on which modes work well.  
Please check them with `wlr-randr` or with game configuration and tell us which modes work with your panel.
